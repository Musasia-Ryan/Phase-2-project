# # KING COUNTY HOUSE PREDICTION ANALYSIS

## Introduction
The King County House Dataset contains information about various columns such as price, house id, rooms, size, location, condition, grade, and many more real estate vocabulary features that describe houses in Washington King County, which is located in Washington State in the U.S.A
In this article, I'll use Python to build a linear regression model to help predict house prices

## Project Description
A real estate agency wants to maximise its profits by being able to accurately predict house prices.

## Experimental Design
1. Data Understanding
2. Data Cleaning
3. Uni-variate Analysis
4. Bi-variate Analysis
5. Modelling
6. Conclusion
7. Recommendations
### Success Criteria
Creation of a model with high accuracy.
### Dataset
The dataset availed by the school.
# Conclusion
1. Features such as condition , bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living15 and sqft_living of the house should be put into consideration because they affect prices positively .
# Recommendations
1. I could very well recommend that the Agency use the last model because it has a higher r squared value of 0.63, which translates to 63% model accuracy.
2. If the Agency wants to increase its sales, I recommend that they focus on building average grade 7 houses because the majority of buyers prefer to buy this type of houses.
